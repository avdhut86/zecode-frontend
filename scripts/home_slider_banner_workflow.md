# Home Page Slider & Category Banner Workflow

## Goal
Generate and apply new "nana banana pro" themed images for the home page slider and category banners (Men, Women, Kids, Footwear) using existing reference images and an image‑editing API.

## Prerequisites
1. **Google API key** (or any image‑editing service key) set in the environment:
   ```powershell
   $env:IMAGE_API_KEY="your-key"
   $env:API_ENDPOINT="https://your-api.com/v1/edit"
   ```
2. Python 3.7+ and the `requests` library (installed via `pip install requests`).
3. Ensure the reference images exist:
   - `public/products/model-poses/…` for Men & Women
   - `public/products/extracted-products/…` for Kids
4. The `.env` file in `scripts/` should contain the above variables (see `scripts/.env`).

## Files
- `scripts/edit_images.py` – reads the references, calls the API, saves edited images to `public/hero` and `public/categories`.
- `scripts/generate_images.js` – optional placeholder copy script.
- `scripts/.env` – holds `IMAGE_API_KEY` and `API_ENDPOINT`.

## How It Works
1. **Load references** – the script builds a map of source images for each target banner.
2. **API call** – for each source image it sends a prompt like:
   > "Apply the 'nana banana pro' style, keep all graphics, colors, and text exactly as in the source. Return a high‑quality PNG with a white background."
3. **Save results** – edited images are written to:
   - `public/hero/hero1.png`
   - `public/categories/men.jpg`
   - `public/categories/women.jpg`
   - `public/categories/kids.jpg`
   - `public/categories/footwear.jpg`
4. **Rate‑limit handling** – the script retries on `429` errors with exponential back‑off (2 s → 4 s → 8 s …) and respects a 2‑second pause between requests.

## Running the Workflow
```bash
# From the project root
cd zecode-frontend/scripts
python edit_images.py   # generates the final images
# Optional: verify placeholders
node generate_images.js
```
After the script finishes, start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to confirm the new slider and banners appear.

## Notes & Tips
- If you add new reference images, just update the paths in `edit_images.py`.
- To use a different image‑editing service, modify `API_ENDPOINT` and adjust the request payload accordingly.
- The script logs each step; check the console for any failed requests.
- All generated images are overwritten on each run, so you can safely re‑run after tweaking prompts.
